# Cleanup

Handle cleaning up data of all sorts. This is a good replacement for the [Debris](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Debris) service with additional features.

## ⚠️ Refactor Notice

This package is in need of refactoring and updates. At the moment, it is not recommended for new work, and is not available via Wally.

## Example

This is an example of how to utilize Cleanup:
```lua
local Cleanup = require(path.to.Cleanup)

local messyTable = {Junk = 3, Garbage = "abcd", Stuff = true}
print("Before:", messyTable) --> Before: {["Garbage"] = "abcd", ["Junk"] = 3, ["Stuff"] = true}
Cleanup:DestroyTable(messyTable)
print("After:", messyTable) --> After: {}

local tempPart = Instance.new("Part")
tempPart.Parent = workspace
Cleanup:ScheduleInstance(tempPart, 5)

```
Along with the output, you will see the created Part be destroyed after the time interval.
